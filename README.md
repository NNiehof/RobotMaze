### Note:
The Arduino compiler includes all source code in the `libraries` directory,
regardless of what is indicated in header files.

For this reason, source and header files for use on Arduino are in 
`./src/libraries/<subfolder>`.
Build files and source code for testing and debugging in pure C++
are in `./src/<subfolder>`.
